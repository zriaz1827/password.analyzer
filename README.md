The proposed project aims to develop a Password Strength Analyzer tool that assesses the strength of user-provided passwords based on various criteria such as length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Additionally, the tool will provide helpful suggestions to improve weak passwords, enhancing overall cybersecurity awareness.
The objective of this project is to develop a program that evaluates the strength of a userâ€™s password based on various security factors, including length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters), and provides feedback on how to improve the password. This tool aims to enhance user awareness of password security and encourage the creation of stronger, more secure passwords.
