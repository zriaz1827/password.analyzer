This project aims to design and implement a Bus Seat Reservation System that allows users to reserve seats, view seat availability, and cancel reservations. The system will be simple to use, featuring a terminal-based interface that provides users with clear visual feedback on seat reservations.
The reservation system will be implemented using C++ and will simulate a 5x6 seating arrangement. The system will allow for real-time interaction, enabling seat reservations and cancellations dynamically.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a working reservation system that fulfills the following objectives:
1.	Provide a user-friendly interface for reserving and canceling bus seats.
2.	Manage seating arrangements for a bus with 5 rows and 6 columns.
3.	Display up-to-date seat availability in a visual format.
4.	Ensure data consistency by preventing double reservations of the same seat.
5.	Allow users to cancel reservations easily
